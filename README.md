# Hyperparameter-Tuning-with-GridSearchCV-Sklearn
 In almost any Machine Learning project, we train different models on the dataset and select the one with the best performance. However, there is room for improvement as we cannot say for sure that this particular model is best for the problem at hand. Hence, our aim is to improve the model in any way possible. One important factor in the performances of these models are their hyperparameters, once we set appropriate values for these hyperparameters, the performance of a model can improve significantly. In this Notebook, we will find out how we can find optimal values for the hyperparameters of a model by using GridSearchCV.
